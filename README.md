# GOVT 275 Final Project Map

This was an interactive map I created using the leaflet CRAN package for my GOVT 275 final project. It provides a visualization of the average legislative effectiveness score (LES) of each state's Senate delegation during the 117th Congress. LES values were provided by the University of Virginia's [Center for Effective Lawmaking.](https://thelawmakers.org/)
